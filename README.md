#Hello everyone!
<!--
I am alxd3x, but for full name purposes I am Alex DePaul. Here is a little about me.

➊ I'm a recent graduate with a degree in communications.
➋ I am a fan of education and continuing to learn throughout life. I'm currently learning API documentation, particularly using the pattern of REST.
➌ I'm in search of projects where I can help create documentation and increase my experience. I'm certainly open to suggestions and feedback about my work.
➍ As for languages, XML, HTML, and CSS are my strong suits, but I can code in JSON as well and I'm familiar with Python.
➎ If you have any questions, ask me and I will try to answer them!
