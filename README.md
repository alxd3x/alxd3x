# Hello there!
Welcome to the readme file that tells you about me.
## GETTING STARTED WITH ALXD3X
I alxd3x am better known as Alex DePaul. I'm a recent graduate with a degree in communications. I'd like to become a technical writer, a profession which may also be referred to as a documentation specialist, an information developer, or simply super awesome README creator.
## FEATURES
Coding in XML, HTML, and CSS are my strong suits. But I can also code in JSON and am familiar with a few commands in Python.
## INSTALLATION OF ALXD3x
I'm looking for projects that I can contribute to with what I know best, documentation. Getting experience is the best thing for me at the moment.
## UPDATES & PATCHES
Education is very important to me and I am always looking for ways to improve. Currently I am learning API documentations, particularly following the REST style.
